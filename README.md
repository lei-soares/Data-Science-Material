# Data Science Material

Welcome to the **Data-Science-Material** repository! This space is
dedicated to storing and sharing high-quality resources, notes,
exercises, and reference material related to **Data Science** and **Data
Analytics**.

##  Overview

This repository gathers essential content to support learning and
practice in the field of Data Science. It includes concepts,
explanations, examples, and practical assets covering topics such as:

-   Python for Data Analysis
-   Statistics & Probability
-   Data Wrangling & Cleaning
-   Data Visualization
-   Machine Learning (Supervised & Unsupervised)
-   SQL

-   And more...

A significant amount of the content comes from the **30 Codecademy
courses** I have completed, along with additional complementary material
gathered from real-world projects and personal studies.

##  Purpose

The objective of this repository is to:

-   Serve as a personal knowledge base.
-   Provide a well-organized reference for concepts in Data Analytics.
-   Be a starting point for tutorials, case studies, and educational
    content.
-   Facilitate revision and reinforcement of important topics.
